      "\n",
      "**Enhancements and Clarifications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Specificity in the \"Why in News\" section:**  Instead of just mentioning the notification of Central Service Rules, briefly explain *why* this specifically reignited the dispute.  For example,  it could be framed as:  \"The recent notification of Central Service Rules for Chandigarh employees, instead of the Punjab Service Rules, reignited the long-standing dispute as it's perceived by Punjab as a further erosion of its claim to the city.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clarify the 1970 announcement:** The statement \"the capital project area of Chandigarh should, as a whole, go to Punjab\" needs more context.  Was this a formal agreement, a statement of intent, or something else?  Adding a qualifier would improve accuracy.  For instance: \"In 1970, the Centre *unofficially indicated* that the capital project area of Chandigarh should, as a whole, go to Punjab...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Expand on the Rajiv-Longowal Accord's implications:** The summary mentions the agreement to transfer Chandigarh, but it doesn't discuss the reasons for the failure of this agreement.  Mentioning Longowal's assassination and the subsequent escalation of the Punjab insurgency would provide crucial context.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Detail different types of UTs:** The description of Union Territories could benefit from more detailed categorization.  Instead of just mentioning \"with or without a legislative assembly,\"  explain the differences in administrative powers and the role of the Lieutenant Governor in each type. For example,  mention the Delhi model as a unique case, highlighting its special status and the differences in powers between the LG and the elected government.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Add a conclusion:** Summarize the current status of the dispute and the potential implications of Punjab's resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Strengthen the Mains answer points:**  The Mains points are good, but they could be expanded.  For example, under \"Federalism,\" discuss the implications of the dispute for the balance of power between the Centre and the States.  Under \"Centre-State Relations,\" discuss the historical context of the evolving relationship between the Centre and Punjab, and how the Chandigarh issue reflects broader tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Incorporate the PYQ answer more seamlessly:** Instead of presenting it as a separate block, integrate the information from the PYQ into the main body of the text, perhaps within the section discussing the administrative history of Chandigarh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Revised Snippet Example (incorporating some suggestions):**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"...In 1970, the Centre *issued a non-binding statement* indicating that the capital project area of Chandigarh should, as a whole, go to Punjab.  Haryana was given five years to build its own capital and use the existing Chandigarh facilities in the interim. However,  Haryana did not build a new capital, and Chandigarh remained a Union Territory...The Rajiv-Longowal Accord of 1985, while agreeing to transfer Chandigarh to Punjab by January 26, 1986, ultimately failed due to the assassination of Longowal shortly after the agreement, leading to a resurgence of militancy and further complicating the already fraught situation...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these suggestions, you can create a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of the Chandigarh issue.  Remember to cite all sources appropriately.\n",
